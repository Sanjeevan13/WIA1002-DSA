My name is <name> with matric number, <matric num>. I am
majoring in Data Science. This is my first time taking the
Data Structure subject. At the moment, I am feeling nervous about taking this
subject. This is because I am not so confident in my programming skills yet.
I acquired B for my previous Programming 1 course. Itâ€™s not too bad. So, I
think I can manage to get A for this DS subject this term. In order
to do well in the subject, I will work twice as hard as than before. Wish me luck!!!
